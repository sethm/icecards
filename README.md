# BÍN Scraper

BÍN (Beygingarlýsing íslensks nútímamáls) is an online database of
Icelandic grammatical forms. It contains full declensions and
conjugations for thousands of words in the Icelandic language. This
utility can compile Anki flash cards based on this data. It is very
much a work in progress, and probably only useful for myself at the
moment.
